# Kontroller

This is an application to control your pc,mac,tv,ipad etc as a mouse or keyboard using the Bluetooth HID Device profile in Android 9(Pie) & above devices. App is currently in development. 

Me & Dima Rostopira(https://github.com/rostopira/) are the collaborators on this project.Even though all the commits on github show that they are done by me on the master branch, Half the code is written by Dima Rostopira and half by me. 


To connect other devices with your app you need to open the app on your phone and connect to your device via bluetooth

Please report any bugs you may have on your devices. If anyone is willing to contribute....they are welcome.

Procedure to use the app:
1) Remove previous pairings with the host device in bluetooth settings(This has to be done once)
2) Open the app
3) Send a pairing request from the host device to the controlling device
4) Accept the pairing on the device running Kontroller
5) Use as Mouse/keyboard for your host device 

Many device manufacturers have disabled the Bluetooth HID device profile on their devices. You would have to ask your device manufacturers to enable it. You can check with this app {[Bluetooth HID Device Profile Compatibility Checker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rkaneapplabs.bluetooth_hid.bluetoothproxy)} if the Bluetooth HID device profile is disabled for you or not.

For OnePlus users- you can upvote this [Idea](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/converting-one-plus-devices-into-a-bluetooth-controller-mouse-keyboard-etc.1192272/) in the community forums after login(This may help in bringing the issue into notice to One Plus). (If any One Plus 8/8Pro or 8T or One Plus Nord) user see's the repo, I need to do some testing on these one plus devices to check if the feature is enabled on them or not. If you have one of these devices and are cool and fine with letting me do some testing on your device.Feel free to create an issue.
